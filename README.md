# OpenWorld_Slash_UE5
UE5 final practice project from https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/ (With many personal addings)

BlackAlder, AncientContent, Megascans, ParagonMinions and MedievalDungeon files were discarded from hierarchy because of the git-lfs size problem. For a successful build, those folders are necessary. Keep in touch via my email for further files: uerden4601@floridapoly.edu
